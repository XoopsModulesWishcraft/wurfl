>So... What is WURFL?
>WURFL is a Device Description Repository (DDR), i.e. a software component which contains the descriptions of thousands of mobile devices. In its simplest incarnation, WURFL is an XML configuration file plus a set of programming APIs to access the data in real-time environments. The main scope of the WURFL Project is to be an independent central repository of device information, which Open-Source developers from around the globe can utilize to build their mobile web applications.

>All the information listed in WURFL has been collected by ScientiaMobile and the community of WURFL users from many different countries. WURFL can be used in any application, free or commercial. In the spirit of the originators of the project, open-source developers who adopt WURFL should share device information with the rest of the community. This will help WURFL to grow better and better every day.

>WURFL is deployed by companies such as Facebook and Google. Carriers around the globe deploy it in mission-critical environment with fantatistic performance and reliability. In terms of adoption, WURFL is today more popular than UAProf solutions and solutions from commercial DDR vendors.


This will allow theme designers and module writters to search for data regarding mobile computing and allow for knowledge in the theme of RSS, CSS, Display Size, Image Types, Sound Fontage, and other data such as SMS and MMS.. As well as information about CHTML or XHTML sources.
